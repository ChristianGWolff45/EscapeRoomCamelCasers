# EscapeRoomCamelCasers
This proejct is a Java based point and click escape room story game designed to give a good quality, puzzle driven experience. Our game provides an immersive alternative to the expensive brick and mortor escape rooms without sacrificing challenege or atmosphere. Our game features an asymmetric design, where players engage in logical reasoning and puzzle solving through a rich set of interconnected challenges. Using a graphical interface built with Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Java Swing, the game overlays interactive elements on top of real photographs, this approach grounds the experience in realism while maintaining the flexibility and creativeness of a software driven puzzle. Each puzzle solved advances the narritive and unlocks new areas, steadily drawing players deeper into the escape room's mystery. By combining static photographs, software driven logic, and immersive storytelling, our escape room delivers the tension, atmosphere, and excitement of an in-person experience directly through the screen.
