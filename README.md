# EscapeRoomCamelCasers
Our project is a Java-based point-and-click escape room story game designed to deliver a high quality, puzzle-driven experience, our game provides an immersive alternative to expensive brick-and-mortar escape rooms without sacrificing challenge or atmosphere.
The game will feature an asymmetric design, where players engage in logical reasoning and puzzle-solving through a rich set of interconnected challenges. Using a graphical user interface built with Java’s Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Swing, the game overlays interactive elements on top of real photographs taken from within an actual building. This approach grounds the experience in realism while maintaining the flexibility of software-driven puzzle logic.
Players will interact with the environment through a point-and-click interface. Hovering over interactive items will highlight them or change the mouse pointer to signal clickability, making the navigation intuitive. Each solved puzzle will advance the narrative and unlock new areas, steadily drawing the player deeper into the escape room’s mystery.
By combining static photographic realism, software-driven logic, and immersive storytelling, our escape room delivers the tension, atmosphere, and excitement of an in-person experience directly through the screen.
